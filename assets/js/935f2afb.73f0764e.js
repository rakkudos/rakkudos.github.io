Our NFT collection, Rakkudos, will act as a catalyst for the growth of the Shakudo Platform. Unlike most NFT collections seen these days we have a working product in market pre-mint that is being used by a broad range of companies. The mint proceeds will go towards marketing campaigns and expanding the developer team. We chose an NFT over a token because we believe in the power of community. There is a lot to be said about the community growth benefits of having a strong holder backing using a Rakkudo NFT as their picture on social platforms such as Twitter.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
